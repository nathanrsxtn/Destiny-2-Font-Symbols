# Destiny 2 Font Symbols
The font icons on this site were from the fonts folder in the Destiny 2 files, and button styles are from [Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/).
The scanner folder contains a short script to search a font for characters in a certain range (only works in browsers that don't draw missing characters).
The site can be accessed from [this link](https://nathanrsxtn.github.io/Destiny-2-Font-Symbols/) (made for the Steam overlay).
Clicking on symbols **copies** the symbol. You will have to use the usual keyboard shortcut to paste it into your username or in-game chat (the symbols will only show up in-game).
